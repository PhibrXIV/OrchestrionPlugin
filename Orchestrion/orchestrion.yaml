  Orchestrion Plugin allows you to change the currently playing in-game BGM. It includes
  a curated list of the most accurate in-game song titles, so you know exactly what's playing,
  if you want to know later! Add favorite songs to separate them from the rest.
  Note: This plugin does not currently allow you to play actual orchestrion songs.
punchline: Adds a simple front-end for browsing and changing the in-game BGM.
